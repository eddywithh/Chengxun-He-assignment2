Writeup: Chengxun He & Samantha Ranjo worked together.

What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
Some challenges that we faced while making this app was how to integrate all the pages together to create a cohesive app. We used Render to host the code, and neither of us has used this web hosting service before. We were also challeneged with making sure that the logic was easy to follow and functional, and making sure we followed the rules correctly. Additionally, we also had to learn how to use the color gradient/heatmap because that was also new to us.

Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
Some additional features/designs we would make if we had more time could be some fun animations or a more interactive interface. We could have also played around with different rules since there are many cominations of numbers to use when determining when cells live or die. The game of life also has some interesting history behind it so we definitely could have added a quick navigation to a brief history of the game/Dr. Conway and maybe some of the philosophical lessons from the game.

What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
I think we assumed that the rules were more difficult to implement than it was. When broken down, we had three conditions to follow based on whether the initial cell was alive or dead and at what state the surrounding neighbors are in. We also assumed that useState was going to be used for whether the game was running (has started) or not running. Our assumption was correct there.

How long did this assignment take to complete? (Obviously, this does not need to be a paragraph).
This took us around 20 hours to complete as we were learning new skills (as stated above) and making sure our logic conditions made sense/followed the rules.
